Performance Metrics
===================

MedSegEvaluator provides a comprehensive suite of metrics for evaluating 
medical image segmentation quality. These metrics cover region-level 
overlap, boundary accuracy, surface distances, and volumetric agreement.

This page describes each metric, its mathematical formulation, and 
how to compute it using MedSegEvaluator.

Overview
--------

The available segmentation metrics include:

- Dice Similarity Coefficient
- Intersection over Union (IoU)
- Precision & Recall
- F1 Score
- Hausdorff Distance (HD95)
- Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD)
- Volume Similarity (VS)
- Boundary F1 Score
- Surface Dice

Dice Similarity Coefficient
---------------------------

The Dice coefficient measures the overlap between ground truth and 
predicted segmentation.

Formula::

    Dice = (2 * |A ∩ B|) / (|A| + |B|)

Where: 
``A`` is the set of voxels in the ground truth mask, ``B`` is the set of voxels in the predicted mask.

Usage::

    from performance_metrics import dice_score
    score = dice_score(gt, pred)
