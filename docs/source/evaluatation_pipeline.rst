Single Shot Model Evaluation 
===================

Typical workflow:

1. Load image + ground truth  
2. Compute performance petrics(Dice, HD95, etc.)  
3. Visualizing histogram, Bar plot for the statistical analysis (eg. 95\% Dice Coeffient Interval)
4. Model robustness analysis under perturbation 
5. Visualize uncertainty under perturbation
