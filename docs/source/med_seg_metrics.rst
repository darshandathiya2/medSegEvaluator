Medical Segmentation Metrics
============================

The ``MedicalSegmentationMetrics`` class provides a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics for medical image segmentation across multiple levels of analysis. It includes pixel-level metrics such as Dice, IoU, Precision, Recall, and Specificity; region-level metrics that capture shape and overlap consistency; boundary-based metrics such as surface distances and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95); and surface-level similarity metrics like Average Surface Distance (ASD) and Normalized Surface Dice (NSD). Together, these metrics allow detailed assessment of segmentation performance—including volume accuracy, boundary alignment, shape integrity, and robustness—ensuring thorough and clinically meaningful evaluation of medical imaging models.
