# medSegEvaluator

MedSegEvaluator is a modular Python library designed for comprehensive evaluation of medical image segmentation models, focusing on accuracy, robustness, and image quality. It provides an easy-to-use framework to assess segmentation performance across multiple dimensions — from voxel-level similarity to volumetric and morphological consistency.

## Key Feature

- **Segmentation Metrics**
  - Dice, IoU, Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Average Surface Distance (ASD)
- **Morphological Analysis**
  - Lesion volume, connected component (island) count, and 2D/3D area evaluation
- **Visualization Tools**
  - Contour overlays, histograms, and boxplots for metric distributions
- **Robustness Assessment**
  - Evaluate how segmentation quality changes under image perturbations or quality degradation
